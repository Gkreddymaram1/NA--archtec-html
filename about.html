		<h4 style="font-weight:Bold;">N. Rupana Reddy</h4>
		<h5>Founder and Principal Designer</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Mrs. Rupana Reddy is a Principal and Head of Interior Design who believes that there is no room for an overarching theme in her work, no one “design approach.” Applying one design
approach uniformly to all projects ensures that the final design falls short of what could be. She believes that each project takes on its own unique identity and style and must be treated as the distinctive entity that it is. Her love of design stems directly from this belief. Listening in a different way allows her to translate a client’s vision into something that they can see in front of them and experience for themselves.</p>
			<p>Rupana has seen a shift in the responsibility of designers over the years. In creating a retail space, designers are now crafting a complex, multi-faceted experience rather than just a
“retail store”. They are creating new destinations where people will come together, connect, and interact with one another as well as with their environment. One of Rupana’s greatest strengths is reimagining these spaces, addressing how people will come through the space and what will attract them. As she looks at a project from many different perspectives, she sees the whole picture and designs at a level above expectations for any given space.
 </p>
			<p>She has been felicitated with numerous prestigious awards for her astounding creations which surprise the clientele every time. What’s more, she inspires the younger generation
to pursue their dreams in the field of Interior Design and ‘achieve beyond’. </p>
